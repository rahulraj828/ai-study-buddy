## 🎯 The Problem

### Students Need Help, But Help Isn't Always Available

**Statistics:**
- 50+ million students in the US struggle with homework
- Only 30% have access to after-school tutoring
- Private tutors cost $30-100/hour (unaffordable for most families)
- 68% of students report feeling stuck on homework regularly

**Current Solutions Fall Short:**
- ❌ Google Search: Hard to type complex equations, generic results
- ❌ YouTube: Time-consuming, may not address specific question
- ❌ Study groups: Not always available when needed
- ❌ Parents: May not understand advanced subjects
